      <p>
        The game is played using only the mouse.
      </p>

      <p>
        To begin, click on the "Start Game" button on the main menu. You will be
        brought to the character selection screen
      </p>
      <p>
        You may inspect the attributes of each of the characters by hovering
        over each of them in turn, and when you have decided which character you
        would like to play as, simply click on them to select, and confirm your
        choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game will begin, and you may advance through the story by clicking
        the "next" button in the story window. When battles commence you may
        choose from a list of commands - attack, magic, and item.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you make your selection your character will take their turn, after
        which the computer gets a chance to retaliate. Both the player and the
        computer take it in turns to use a command of their choice until one
        person wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the player wins, you will progress through the story until you defeat
        the final enemy.
