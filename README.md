## Project Background

This project is being completed as part of a Full Stack Developer Diploma award. This forms the basis for the developer's second milestone project. As such it will be completed within a set of guidelines as to which technologies to use.

While the core focus of the project is to be submitted as the summative assessment for the student developers course, it is also hoped that the resource itself, and the brand created for it can be developed over time into something that can be of value to the wider community.

## UX Design

### Goals

Design phase goals:

- Identify user profile
- Generate user stories
- Create wireframe
- Develop a brand identity
- Create high fidelity prototype

The website is conceived as a resource for to extend the existing brand of Greetings Heroes. Typically Greetings Heroes is a fun, interactive, live, role-playing story-telling workshop where children are encouraged to explore their creative writing skills. However this resource is hoped to provide an additional opportunity to be incorprated into this workflow which would allow children to play with their created characters after their story is completed.

Therefore the user profile for this application is children between the ages of 9 and 14, who have completed a series of Greetings Heroes workshops already and have created characters and a narrative during these workshops.

### User Stories

- As a user I should be able to start, pause, and stop the game at will
- As a user I should be able to choose whether to attack, use a spell, or use an item during each turn
- As a user I should be able to inspect both my remaining health and magic points, as well as what items I have available
- As a user I should be able to see read the narrative at my own pace and advance it when I am ready
- As a user I should be able to choose my character from a list of four at the beginning of the game
- As a user I should be able to inspect the attributes of each available character
- As a user I should receive feedback when I win a battle, complete the game, or fail
- As a user I should be able to progress to three separate battles in order to win the game
- As a user I should be able to read story narrative before and after each battle
- As a user I should be able to read instructions about how to play the game

## Featuresgit 

### StartStopPause

This should allow the user to pause the game at any point, as well as start the game if the game is not already running, and to stop the game if the game is already running.

### ChooseAction

During each turn of a battle the user should be able to choose from a predetermined list of actions they can choose to take, for example "attack", "use magic", or "use item"

### HUD

During battles the users should clearly be able to see relevant information regarding their characters status, including health points and magic points

### AdvanceStory

During exposition of story, the story should be displayed in small blocks at a time rather than in one large block. The user should be able to choose what speed the next block appears by means of a keypress

### CharacterSelect

At the start of each game the user should be presented with a choice of four characters with different strengths and weaknesses to choose from. Once selected, this choice will remain in effect until the game ends

### InspectCharacter

During the character selection process the user should be able to inspect the characters stats to decide which strengths and weaknesses to favour

### GameResult

When the game ends the user should see either a positive or negative message depending on whether they succeeded or failed. Additionally they should see feedback each time they emerge from a battle victorious

### Game

The game proper should consist of a linear path that the character is set on, interspersing exposition of "story blocks" in between battles. There should be a total of three battles. If the player emerges victorious from the third and final battle, they win the game, and if they are defeated at any point they lose

### Story

Story blocks should appear at the start of the game, after the first battle, after the second battle, and after the final battle. They should be displayed on a separate screen, for example a modal to distinguish between action (battles) and exposition (story)

### Wireframes

Wireframes are generated to accomodate the majority of user stories. Still to be implemented are #StartStopPause, #AdvanceStory, #InspectCharacter.

Once the user stories are completed, [wireframes](https://xd.adobe.com/view/c7beac65-48a1-4dbd-a945-279ed1bd52ec-92ed/) are generated to form the layout of the website which allow the target user to achieve their goals. The wireframes are generated to accommodate three different screen sizes in a responsive layout:

- MacBook Pro (2019)
- iPad Pro (12.9")
- iPhone X

### Color Palette

Next, the brand is designed. This involves the creation of a [logo](#), compiling of a [color palette](https://color.adobe.com/Greetings-Heroes-color-theme-15326853), and selection of appropriate [font choices](https://use.typekit.net/twt4nji.css).

The colors palette chosen for the brand consist mainly of deep reds. The reds represent the the excitement, danger, and courage that are qualities that a hero must possess. Additionally purple is used as a highlight colour, representing magic and imagination.

Initial hues were selected based on these representations of the brand, and then fine tuned using [Adobe Color Picker](https://color.adobe.com/create) to select a colour palette that would complement itself, and to ensure accessibility for persons with difficulty discerning colours.

### Typography

[Gothicus Roman](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gothicus) is selected as the primary typeface for the major headings because of its ancient, gothic qualities which lend itself well to fantasy. [Courier Prime](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/courier-prime) is chosen to complement it through the body text, because of its clarity and legibility, but additionally because Courier is the standard font for screenplays, and since the nature of this project is that children would have created this world themselves, that they would experience seeing their story typed out on the screen in front of them.

### Imagery

[Freepik](http://www.freepik.com) was used for the main title image. As such the following code must be included to conform with their free licensing agreement. `<a href="">Designed by freepic.diller / Freepik</a>`

### Iconography

[Material Io](https://material.io/resources/icons) was used to source basic icons for sound on/off, information, and exit application. Additionally icons for LinkedIn and Github were sourced from their respective official websites.

### Prototype

With these decisions in place, a high fidelity [prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/b053e336-3558-410b-bda6-40c7af002eba-e500/) is created drawing together all strands of the design to show what the developed project will look like. Decisions such as placement of content, sizing of images, application of colour and typography palettes are taken at this point.

Logic for creating custom modal using Javascript, CSS, and the shadow DOM was customised from content on Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course "Javascript - The Complete Guide 2020"

I received inspiration for this project from:
